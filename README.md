# Bounded Paths

### UPM Install Link
```
https://github.com/LiamBoog/Bounded-Paths.git
```

A Unity package that enables the creation of `BoundedPath` objects, which are 2D paths with arbitrary[^1] boundaries. This contrasts other path tools which generally create paths with arbitrary centerlines but a constant width. With `Bounded Paths`, path boundaries may be shaped however the user likes, using splines, and the path's mesh and centerline will be updated in real-time.
